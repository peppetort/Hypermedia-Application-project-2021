## Technical Documentation

### Server

To implement the server we used the _Express_ framework.<br/>
By sending a request to the specific URL, the data is extracted from the database and sent back in the form of JSON.

### DB

To implement the DB we used _Sequelize_.<br/>
For the purpose of the project every time we force the creation of the tables and repopulate the DB.<br/>
The population is done through a function that reads a JSON file in which the content for each table is specified. <br/> In JSON the images are specified as relative path, so they are read by the function and encoded in Base64.

### Components

#### **TheHeader.vue**

Repeated on each page, it represents the navigation bar through which you can navigate the site. <br/>
In order to improve the responsiveness of the site, when the screen size drops below 900px, the menu turns into a _burger menu_. Then the `<div class = "nav-mobile">` is shown and the `<div class =" nav ">` is hidden.</br>
The header sticks to the top and is present in every phase of the navigation in order to have an effective way to move around the website in every moment.</br>
It consists in a men√π bar that contains links to all the main pages of TechToch.</br>


#### **TheFooter.vue**

Repeated on each page, it represents the footer of the site.</br>


#### **TheSection.vue**

Since the site structure has repeated component patterns, we decided to reuse the component to represent a section with a horizontal layout. <br/>
In order to be able to increase the adaptability of the component, we have made it as customizable as possible.

- **`props`** list specifies the properties of the context:

1. the background color [```light``` or ``` strong```]
2. the orientation of the component [```right``` to have the text in the right half, ```left``` to have the text in the left half]
3. if present (optional) adds a button of the specified type [``` strong``` for a dark button, ```light``` for a light button]

- **`title`** if specified (optional) inserts an element of type _h1_

- **`subtitle`** if specified (optional) inserts an element of type _h2_

- **`text`** list creates an element of type _p_ for each element within it

- **`image`** specifies the image to display

- **`alt`** specifies the _alt_ for the image

- **`link`** if present (optional) specifies the link to go to when the button is pressed

- **`button`** attribute if present (optional) specifies the text to disaply inside the button

#### **PageIntro.vue**

Represents the introductory section repeated on the main pages. It is composed of a div with a video as a background.

- **`title`** if specified (optional) inserts an element of type _h1_

- **`subtitle`** inserts an element of type _h2_

- **`video`** is the link to the background video

- **`loop`** specifies whether the video should be looped or not

- **`image`** if specified (optional) is the link to the image that will appear in the center of the div

- **`alt`** specifies the _alt_ for the image

- **`dimension`** specifies the height of the div between two possible choices [```large``` or ``` small```]

#### **TheNavBar.vue**

Represents the Orientation Info. It allows you to see your position within the site with respect to the parent pages.

- **`path`** bi-dimensional list: the name to be displayed with the respective path
- **`look`** specifies the background color [```strong```, ```light```]

#### **CardFeature.vue**

Component that represents a card with a title an image and a text used to describe the features of a site object.

- **`title`** inserts an element of type _h3_
- **`text`** inserts an element of type _p_
- **`image`** attribute specifies the image to display
- **`alt`** attribute specifies the _alt_ for the image

#### **CardPreview.vue**

Clickable component formed by image and text used to show the preview of objects

- **`title`** inserts an element of type _p_
- **`link`** specifies the link to go to when the component is pressed
- **`image`** attribute specifies the image to display
- **`alt`** attribute specifies the _alt_ for the image

#### **CardPerson.vue**

Represents the card dedicated to a person in order to create a preview and provide a quick link to his page

- **`title`** inserts an element of type _h2_ which specifies the role
- **`name`** inserts an element of type _p_ specifying the name
- **`link`** specifies the link to go to when the button is pressed
- **`image`** specifies the image of the person to display
- **`alt`** specifies the _alt_ for the image

#### **Chat.vue**

Component that represent a multimodal chatbot that interacts with the website

- **`chat_list`** list of messages visualized in the chat synchronized with a property in the store through a watcher: messages that arrive from the chat and that are sent are added in the store, and the watcher update the list

### Plugins

The only plugin we have used is mmcc, which allowed us to create a modal chatbot inside our application by providing a WebSocket to communicate with the backed chatbot service. The advantage of using it is that can be easily integrated by simply installing it and importing all the needed components. 

## Usage of Nuxt best practices

In order to have better performances and to optimize the site for SEO we have chosen to use the Server Side Rendering approach.<br/>
We have also created as many components as possible to make the page structure modular, therefore easier to modify, restructure and read.<br/>
For each component created we have tried to make it as parametric as possible in order to favor the reusability of the code written duringthe development of the application</br>
Since we wanted a code that's as modular as possible and since we created various components that are always present during the visualization of the website, such as <code>TheHeader.vue</code>, <code>TheFooter.vue</code> or <code>TheNavbar.vue</code>, we decided to use a single and shared layout page, that serves as a template, with the header already on top and the footer on bottom in every page. It also contains CSS styles that will be valid for the whole website.</br>
Since the header and the footer are used inside of the layout, and therefore they're instantiated before the data fetch, we used the store in order to make the needed dynamic data from the database available earlier.</br>
